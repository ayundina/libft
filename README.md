# libft
Recoded a number of standard C library functions, as well as other utility functions that will be reused 

# Use example
[get_next_line](https://github.com/ayundina/libft/blob/master/get_next_line.c) and [ft_printf](https://github.com/ayundina/libft/tree/master/ft_printf) use some of libft functions.
